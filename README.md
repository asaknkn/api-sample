# opa-frontend
A simple site to try Online Payment Api(OPA) provided by PayPay on browser.

Basically frontend can't access to PayPay's backend server due to priventing from  Same-Origin Policy.
Therefore you need to  prepare for a backend server.
If you don't have it,  you can use [a simple backend server](https://github.com/asaknkn/opa-backend)
